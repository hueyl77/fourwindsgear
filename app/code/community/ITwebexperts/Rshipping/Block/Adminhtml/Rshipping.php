So say you have a 2 day ship method, a 5 day ship method, etc and you want to dynamically add to the calendar reservation turnover time (padding) based on the ship method, rather than using a global turnover time. That is what this setting is for.
If you use Reservation Ship Methods â€“ your customer will see on the product page a zip code entry field to get the shipping quote and ship method turnover time.
You can add your ship methods under Rentals > Reservation Ship Methods. You will need to make sure that the ship methods you use are also enabled in System >config> ship methods.
